# MALACA_CNN_Image_Classification_Ovarian_Tumour
Image classification approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the presence of tumors in ovarian tissue images. Specifically, two pre-trained models, MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3, and one new CNN architecture will be utilized to classify custom datasets.
